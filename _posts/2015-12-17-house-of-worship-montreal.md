# House of Worship Montreal

House of Worship Montreal is a worship ministry based in Montreal, Quebec that seeks to make the name of Jesus Christ known to the city through the gift of music. By God's grace, we want to invite as much people to join in the song of worship to our God through various worship jam sessions and through worship busking in the Montreal metro stations.

The idea and the concept of HOWM all started with a spontaneous jam session at the beginning of the school year. We all thought we were just going to gather together to play and make music, but the Holy Spirit had other plans.

We were jamming to a few worship songs in the beginning, but after one thing led to another, we realized that we have been worshipping Jesus for 4 hours straight. We couldn't believe what just happened in our midst. We knew that God was up to something great through this ministry, and we strongly believe that God wants to revive the city of Montreal in Jesus Christ through worship.

We dream of the day to see every person in the city of Montreal to come to know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and for them to experience the endless wonder of His love through worship. We long to see the day of hearing the news where people are constantly gathering together to worship in apartment suites. We desire to hear songs of praise to our King in the metro Stations. We are ready to see people in need of a Savior, like us, lay down their lives at the feet of Jesus in worship. We're excited to see what the Holy Spirit has yet to do in Montreal through this ministry. Let the name of Jesus Christ be exalted and lifted high!

"I learned God-worship when my pride was shattered. Heart-shattered lives ready for love don't for a moment escape God's notice." Psalm 51:17 (MSG)
