# Workshops

**How to Maximize Your Life for Eternity**  
We all have a limited number of days on this earth. Have you ever thought how you can maximize the ripple effects of your life into eternity? Whether you stay in Canada after graduation or go overseas, get involved in marketplace ministry or full-time ministry, you can make a significant contribution toward reaching the world for Christ. At this seminar, you'll hear about practical ways that you can pray, give, and go as you seek to live in line with God's heart for the nations.

**Physics and the Existence of God**  
In the last 100 years, mainstream physics has found itself at a dead end with respect to finding a natural explanation for the origin of the cosmos. At the same time, there has been significant fine-tuning of the constants found in the laws of physics that provide evidence that the universe was designed to support life. In this seminar, Kirk Durston will present his own version of the cosmological argument and a design argument.

**Breaking Through Shame**  
Have you ever wondered what underlies many of our deepest interpersonal and mental health struggles? The answer, in a nutshell, is shame. Shame is part of the air we breathe and the culture we live in. But no one really wants to talk about it and so it rarely gets addressed. In this workshop, Thomas breaks through this silence and talks openly about pathways through shame that will transform the relationship we have with ourself, with others, and with God. Thomas will teach you how to construct and implement a recovery strategy from the toxic effects of false shame, freeing you to feel more known and loved.
